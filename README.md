# python-paint-program
Overwatch themed paint program created with Python and Pygame that allows drawing with brushes, lines, shapes, filling, text, backgrounds, and stamps. It also
includes a gradient colour selector, filters, undo/redo, image saving/loading to PNG files, and tabs to allow multiple canvases at once.
You can check it out in the YouTube video below.

NOTE: I removed all asset files such as backgrounds, music and sprites using a .gitignore due to copyright
